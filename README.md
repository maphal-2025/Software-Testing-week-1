# Software-Testing-week-1
Key Concepts
# Importance of Software Testing
Software testing ensures functionality, performance, and reliability ‚Äî helping teams deliver quality products and minimize risks.

# Errors vs. Defects vs. Failures
Term	Description
Error	A human mistake made during coding or design.
Defect	A flaw in the software caused by an error.
Failure	An observable malfunction during execution due to a defect.

# Testing Principles
Defect detection, not absence assurance
Early testing reduces future cost
-Exhaustive testing is impossible
-Defect clustering follows the 80/20 rule
-Beware the Pesticide Paradox ‚Äî evolve your tests continuously
-Testing is context-dependent

# Static vs. Dynamic Testing
Testing Type	Description	Example Techniques
Static	Testing without executing code	Code reviews, static analysis
Dynamic	Requires executing the software	Unit testing, system testing
üèóÔ∏è Testing in the SDLC
Testing isn't just a final phase ‚Äî it's embedded across the lifecycle. Techniques like shift-left testing, Test-Driven Development (TDD), and Continuous Integration ensure quality from the start.
